# In2Touch Unofficial

A personal project to show team and league results for the In2Touch rugby leagues across the UK.
The app allows you to find and pin teams and leagues to your homescreen with data fed from a
Frebase backend. Users can also select themes and view results of other teams.

This project is a rewrite of [in2touch-react](https://github.com/garethweaver/in2touch-react).
The app is built with NextJS although admittedly this was probably not the correct choice üòê

You can find out more about it on my website [garethweaver.com](https://www.garethweaver.com/portfolio/in2touch).
